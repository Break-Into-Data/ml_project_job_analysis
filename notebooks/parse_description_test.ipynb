Additional details of participation in these benefit plans will be provided if an employee receives an offer of employment.\\n\\nIf hired, employee will be in an “at-will position” and the Company reserves the right to modify base salary (as well as any other payment or compensation program) at any time, including reasons related to individual performance, Company or individual department/team performance, and market factors.\\n\\nScilex Holding Company’s pay range data is provided in accordance with local state pay transparency regulations. Scilex Holding Company may post different minimum wage ranges for permanent residency petitions pursuant to US Department of Labor requirements.\\n\\nScilex Holding Company is committed to equal employment opportunities, and a workplace that embraces diversity and inclusion for qualified individuals of all backgrounds.\\n\\nAbout Scilex\\n\\nSCILEX HOLDING COMPANY (Nasdaq: SCLX, “Scilex”), is an innovative revenue-generating company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing non-opioid pain management products for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. We are uncompromising in our focus to become the global pain management leader committed to social, environmental, economic, and ethical principles to responsibly develop pharmaceutical products to maximize quality of life.\\n\\nThe company’s lead product ZTlido® (lidocaine topical system) 1.8%, is a marketed prescription lidocaine topical product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the relief of pain associated with Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN), which is a form of post-shingles nerve pain. ZTlido® possesses novel delivery and adhesion technology designed to address many of the limitations of current prescription lidocaine patches by providing significantly improved adhesion and continuous pain relief throughout the 12-hour administration period. Click here for ZTLido’s Important Safety Information and US Prescribing Information.\\n\\nWe have acquired two FDA approved non-opioid pain products, GLOPERBA and ELYXYBTM, for the treatment of gout in adults and oral solution for the acute treatment of migraine, with or without aura, in adults. We launched ELYXYBTM in the U.S. in April 2023 and are planning to commercialize GLOPERBA in 2024.\\n\\nOur three product candidates are (i) SP-102 (10 mg, dexamethasone sodium phosphate viscous gel) (“SEMDEXATM”), a Phase 3, novel, viscous gel formulation of a widely used corticosteroid for epidural injections to treat lumbosacral radicular pain, or sciatica and has received Fast Track Status from the FDA. Currently there is no FDA approved non-opioid epidural injection to treat lumbosacral radicular pain, or sciatica; (ii) SP-103 (lidocaine topical system) 5.4%, (“SP-103”), a Phase 2, next-generation, triple-strength formulation of ZTlido, for the treatment of low back pain (“LBP”) and has received Fast Track Status from the FDA; and (iii) SP-104 (4.5 mg, low-dose naltrexone hydrochloride delayed-release capsules) (“SP-104”), a novel low-dose delayed-release naltrexone hydrochloride being developed for the treatment of fibromyalgia.
