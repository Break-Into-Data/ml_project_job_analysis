(And because a job description can only contain a fraction of how we operate, click here to learn more about the Tech Team at Tegus!)

As a machine learning engineer at Tegus, your job will be to build product features powered by machine learning on top of our unique, proprietary datasets. The core of this data is an ever-growing set of “expert interviews”--primary research conversations between financial analysts and domain experts, arranged by Tegus, who discuss the ins-and-outs of a particular company’s business. In 2021, Tegus acquired BamSEC, adding a comprehensive database of SEC filings and earnings/events transcripts to the platform. And last year, through our acquisition of Canalyst, we added custom financial models and cleaned financial time series data.

Because so much of this data is unstructured text, your work will lean heavily towards NLP and large language models. While we make extensive use of OpenAI API’s, we plan to explore other vendors, future open source models, and perhaps even custom-trained or fine-tuned models.

As a team, we have already launched LLM-powered transcript summaries and a search/browse experience based on topic extraction. A main focus of our upcoming work will be a chat agent for financial professionals that has access to all of our underlying datasets.

Our work is core to the future of the company. You will join as one of the first hires, reporting to the VP of Machine Learning, and will help to set the culture and practice of how we do machine learning at Tegus. You will also get to work on real business problems using some of the latest and most exciting tools and methods in the industry.

Responsibilites
• Collaborate with product managers, product engineers, and more senior ML engineers to prototype, build, and release features in the Tegus Platform that leverage the latest advances in machine learning applied to our proprietary dataset of financial text.

• 401K plan with an employer match.
• Paid parental leave for all parents.
• Unlimited paid vacation, flexible work hours, and 10 observed paid holidays per year.
• Employer funded long-term disability.
• Award-winning culture with regular team-wide events designed to foster connections and promote creativity.
• Generous employee referral bonus program.
• The opportunity to attend peer-nominated quarterly DEI events.
• Working for a thriving, performance-based company that values promoting from within, career advancement and transparency.

"Senior Machine Learning Engineer (Modeling), Measurement",Square,"Seattle, WA","Company Description

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together...

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

AI Product Engineer,Notion,"San Francisco, CA","About Us:

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft...

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role:

We are looking for an AI Engineer to join our small but nimble AI team whose mission is to make Notion a product that empowers our users to tackle larger problems leveraging AI. As a more experienced member of the team, you will work on determining how best to incorporate large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and other AI technologies into Notion’s product. You’ll be exploring the boundaries of what’s possible with ML technology and finding innovative ways to apply new industry learnings to Notion’s product offering.

What you’ll achieve:
• Work with the team to prototype and experiment with new AI features
• Productionize and launch new AI technology integrations into Notion’s core product
• Collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver product features on time
• Stay up-to-date with the latest AI technologies and trends

Skills You'll Need to Bring:
• Domain Expert, Teacher and Learner: You have experience building AI products using LLMs, embeddings or other ML natural language technologies. 3+ years of experience in one or more of the following areas: machine learning, recommendation or ranking systems, natural language understanding/generation or artificial intelligence. You’re excited about bringing your pre-existing knowledge to the team, but you balance that with perpetual curiosity and understanding that there is always more to learn.
• Pragmatic Problem-solver: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building. You are able to think on your feet, iterate efficiently on new ideas, and are enthusiastic about shifting your thinking as new information comes to light.
• Empathetic communication and leadership: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. You enjoy collaborating with and mentoring fellow engineers and work well with cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
• Impact-orientation and user focus: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals.

Nice to Haves:
• You understand how parts of a system fit together, from the user interface to the data model. You are familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL, and have experience building products from ground up.
• You’re proficient with data pipeline technologies: Spark, DBT, etc
• You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
• You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals’ strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.
• You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
• You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.

We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures.

• Be the connective tissue between Applied Research, GTM, Product, and Engineering, especially when it comes to frontier model techniques for customer use cases.
• Highlight new and creative ways our foundational models can be used for new domains.

You might thrive in this role if you:
• Have 7+ years of software engineering and ML experience.
• Have built and/or delivered prototypes on top of our API platform.
• Have led complex technical projects and programs with many stakeholders.
• Proactively identify opportunities for maximizing our customers’ business value through leveraging the OpenAI API.

• Have a humble attitude and an eagerness to help others with empathy.
• Have a desire to work directly with technical and non-technical customers, be a good listener and interpreter of their needs, and not be afraid to inquire deeper.
• Operate with high horsepower, be adept at frequent context switching and working on multiple projects at once with expansive ownership, and ruthlessly prioritize.
• Thrive in dynamic environments and can navigate ambiguity with ease.
• Promote diversity in thought.
• Be an effective and polished communicator.
• Are passionate about ML, data science, and widening the reach of practical AI technologies.

Data Analyst,Stripe,"Seattle, WA","About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives.

You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements
• 2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
• Proficiency in SQL and Python
• Strong statistical knowledge
• Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends","{""10 days ago"",Full-time,""Health insurance"",""Dental insurance""}",eyJqb2JfdGl0bGUiOiJEYXRhIEFuYWx5c3QiLCJjb21wYW55X25hbWUiOiJTdHJpcGUiLCJodGlkb2NpZCI6Ik9OZGtzSkVWRUp5Z3NUMkNBQUFBQUE9PSIsInEiOiJEYXRhIEFuYWx5c3QgU2VhdHRsZSwgV0EifQ==,2024-05-04

About Scilex

SCILEX HOLDING COMPANY (Nasdaq: SCLX, “Scilex”), is an innovative revenue-generating company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing non-opioid pain management products for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. We are uncompromising in our focus to become the global pain management leader committed to social, environmental, economic, and ethical principles to responsibly develop pharmaceutical products to maximize quality of life.

The company’s lead product ZTlido® (lidocaine topical system) 1.8%, is a marketed prescription lidocaine topical product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the relief of pain associated with Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN), which is a form of post-shingles nerve pain. ZTlido® possesses novel delivery and adhesion technology designed to address many of the limitations of current prescription lidocaine patches by providing significantly improved adhesion and continuous pain relief throughout the 12-hour administration period. Click here for ZTLido’s Important Safety Information and US Prescribing Information.

We have acquired two FDA approved non-opioid pain products, GLOPERBA and ELYXYBTM, for the treatment of gout in adults and oral solution for the acute treatment of migraine, with or without aura, in adults. We launched ELYXYBTM in the U.S. in April 2023 and are planning to commercialize GLOPERBA in 2024.

Our three product candidates are (i) SP-102 (10 mg, dexamethasone sodium phosphate viscous gel) (“SEMDEXATM”), a Phase 3, novel, viscous gel formulation of a widely used corticosteroid for epidural injections to treat lumbosacral radicular pain, or sciatica and has received Fast Track Status from the FDA. Currently there is no FDA approved non-opioid epidural injection to treat lumbosacral radicular pain, or sciatica; (ii) SP-103 (lidocaine topical system) 5.4%, (“SP-103”), a Phase 2, next-generation, triple-strength formulation of ZTlido, for the treatment of low back pain (“LBP”) and has received Fast Track Status from the FDA; and (iii) SP-104 (4.5 mg, low-dose naltrexone hydrochloride delayed-release capsules) (“SP-104”), a novel low-dose delayed-release naltrexone hydrochloride being developed for the treatment of fibromyalgia. If these product candidates are approved by the FDA, we believe each of them could become the treatment option for their respective indications in the United States.

SCILEX is committed to harnessing the power of revolutionary delivery technologies designed to safely and effectively provide therapies to those who need them the most. Scilex Pharmaceuticals and Semnur Pharmaceuticals are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Scilex Holding Company.

If you’re a high-energy, compassionate, and collaborative individual with a strong desire to make a difference in patient’s lives, we encourage you to consider joining the Scilex Holding team!

Lead Data Engineer,Candid Health,"Denver, CO","The Role

At Candid Health, we’re searching for our founding Lead Data Engineer to design, build, and support our next generation of data infrastructure. As a key strategic investment for the company and product, you will be working on highly impactful and visible outcomes. This is an opportunity to get in at the ground floor of designing and building something exciting and new in a secure... durable, performant, and maintainable way with other top-tier talent. You will architect and build our data platform from the ground up, select tools, codify best practices, and lead and mentor others. As the first Lead Data Engineer at Candid Health, you will report to the Head of Engineering and will help to build out a world-class Data Team.

What We Do

We’re fixing one of the most broken and costly pieces of the US healthcare system: medical billing.

Today, healthcare providers spend over $250B each year on administrative overhead just to get paid by insurance. Medical billing is expensive because it’s nuanced and hard - maybe ~100x harder than credit card payment processing - and because it’s traditionally done by armies of humans who track and manage complex rules and processes specific to individual insurance companies with little or no supporting software. We’re rethinking medical billing from the ground up, building software backed by best-in-class data science (and, soon, a dash of machine learning) to automate much of this complexity so healthcare providers can get paid dramatically more easily and inexpensively.

We were in the Y Combinator W20 batch and have since been well funded by a world-class group of funds (8VC, First Round Capital, BoxGroup) + angel investors. We're now helping our customers treat opioid addiction, provide holistic care for women, lose weight, increase access to mental health care, and much more. This is such important and gratifying work; we can't wait for you to join our team and help support some of the most important innovation happening in healthcare today!

What You’ll Do
• Collaborate with leadership, delivery, engineering, product, and customers: Collaborate with leadership and other stakeholders to understand Candid’s data needs. Work with product and engineering to understand the long-term product strategy and broader technical architecture. Work with customers to understand their needs and how best to address them in a scalable way.
• Expansively own Data Engineering team outcomes: Deliver on Data Team outcomes for both internal teams and external customers, which include both operational and analytics workflows.
• Lead design of new data infrastructure: Research and identify industry best practices and state-of-the-art tools to leverage. Design new systems to support the necessary outcomes in a secure, durable, performant, and maintainable way.
• Build and support new data products: Build datasets, pipelines, and other solutions to support operational and product outcomes. Develop support systems to scale the team and achievable outcomes.

Who You Are
• You have Bachelors of Science or Bachelors of Art in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Math or other similar degree.
• You have 6+ years of experience working with data pipelines, products, and tools.
• You’ve built and maintained complex data integrations or pipelines.
• You have well-developed opinions on modern data warehouse architecture, tools, and patterns.
• You have experience with selection and implementation of new tools and process.
• You have excellent technical vision; you know the right architecture and patterns to build functional, durable, and maintainable product.
• You have a customer-first and learner’s mindset, and value teaching others.
• You make the right trade-offs when considering project scope, which corners are worth cutting, and which are not.
• You’re a clear and concise communicator; you enjoy the challenge of explaining complicated ideas in simple terms, both in-person and in writing.
• Experience with the technologies we currently use is a plus, but by no means required: Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Metabase, Terraform, Python.

Our Values

We Spend At Least As Much Time With Our Coworkers As We Do With Our Closest Friends + Family - If We Intend To Do The Most Important + Challenging Work Of Our Lives, It’s Important That These Folks Energize Us, Support Us, Inspire Us, And Push Us To Do Our Best Work.

A little about E Source

Utilities across the US and Canada face the same fundamental, day-to-day challenges: to ensure reliable service for every customer while maintaining and modernizing aging distribution networks and meeting regulatory requirements—all while keeping rates affordable.

At E Source, we’re dedicated to helping every utility become a Sustainable Utility. That means doing the hard work it takes to achieve goals that often seem at odds with one another:
• Environmental responsibility: Decarbonizing operations, reducing emissions, eliminating water leaks, and finding efficiencies
• Reliability: Providing safe, continuous, and consistent service in the face of increasing volatility caused by climate change, including extreme weather, drought, and fire
• Equity: Making services and programs truly available to all, especially low- and moderate-income residential customers and small and midsize businesses who are often disproportionately impacted by societal events
• Financial stability: Ensuring a bottom line that affords capital and operational expenditures while enabling innovation and giving back to our communities

E Source blends industry-leading research, predictive data science, and solution services to help utilities make better decisions to serve their customers, their bottom line, and our planet. With a commitment to practical innovation, we use more than three decades of utility-focused experience and our unique solution set to help our clients become a Sustainable Utility.

Data Engineer,Speak,"San Francisco, CA","About us

Our mission is to become the de facto way people learn foreign languages. We begin by teaching the next billion people English and Spanish...

English is the global language of business, culture, and communication, and over 1.5 billion people around the world are actively trying to learn right now. Others dream of communicating with the half-billion native Spanish speakers across the globe. The problem is that it's nearly impossible to learn to speak a language without constant access to a speaking partner. Grammar and vocab apps don't really help – you need to actually converse with someone.

Speak is on a journey to fix this. We're creating an AI-powered experience that replicates the flow of a conversation, without needing a human on the other end. The goal is to make it radically more accessible to be able to have conversations in a foreign language and eventually help hundreds of millions of people gain fluency who otherwise wouldn't be able to.

We started on this journey over five years ago and we've still got a long ways to go. We're thoughtfully adding new team members only when we think they can truly play a big role in our mission.

Speak launched first in South Korea where we have quickly grown to become the top grossing education app in the country. We have now delivered this winning product to more than 30 countries globally and are continuing to expand to more markets in the coming months. The company is well funded, raising a recent Series B backed by investors like OpenAI, Founders Fund, Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures, Lachy Groom, Josh Buckley, and others.

• Enable Data-Driven Decisions: By collaborating with cross-functional teams, you will develop and deploy tools and frameworks that facilitate data access and analysis, empowering product and business teams to make informed decisions. This includes creating dashboards, reports, and advanced analytics models that reveal user behavior patterns, learning efficacy, and opportunities for product improvement.
• Optimize Data Architecture: Constantly evaluate and refine the data architecture to support our growing data needs and ensure optimal performance. This includes managing data lakes, data warehouses, and databases, as well as implementing best practices for data modeling, data quality, and data governance.
• Support Machine Learning Projects: Work closely with data scientists and machine learning engineers by providing them with clean, structured data for building and deploying predictive models that enhance personalized learning experiences and engagement strategies.
• Innovate and Experiment: Stay ahead of the curve by researching and implementing cutting-edge technologies and methodologies in data engineering and analytics.
• Collaborate Across Teams: As a key player in the engineering team, you'll work closely with product managers, analysts, and other engineers to bring data-driven products and features from concept to launch.
